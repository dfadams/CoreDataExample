I have attempted to use the CoreDataExample as abase and create my own iPad Split View Project.

Initially this will only contain a name but once I get the structure set up I will add further details.

I have come across a few problems in trying to do this.

1. When I enter a name in the Input View and press 'Done' I go back to the Master view but my new entry is not listed.  If I close the app and then reopen it is there.  There seems to be an error in the Log when I do this but the app keeps running and it doesn't crash.

2. When I select an entry in the Master Table view I would like this to display the details in the detail view, I have got this to work, and I would also like this to slide the edit view into place and for the selected entries information to be displayed for editing, I have done this but I am unable to save the edit.

Thanks to anyone that can help with the problems I am having and thanks to the guys that already contributed to the CoreDateExample that I have used to create so much of my iPad version.

Cheers

Daniel
